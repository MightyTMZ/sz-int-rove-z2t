"""
1. No good redemptions available - There might not be any suitable
award options based on the user's input (e.g., no flights or hotels
meeting their criteria).
2. Expired or old award charts - Some rewards programs may have
outdated award charts, and using incorrect data for calculation could
lead to incorrect recommendations.
3. Restricted dates - Certain travel dates might be blacked out,
unavailable, or more expensive due to high demand. The tool should
account for these restrictions when suggesting redemptions.
4. Incomplete input data - Users may not provide all the necessary
information required by the tool, making it difficult to generate
accurate recommendations.
5. Airline-specific restrictions - Some airlines may have additional
limitations on award redemption (e.g., maximum segment length,
stopovers, etc.) that should be considered when developing the
synthetic routing logic.
6. Geopolitical issues and events - Events such as natural disasters
or government restrictions may impact travel to certain destinations,
which could affect the tool's recommendations.
7. Seasonal fluctuations in pricing - Prices for flights, hotels, and
other rewards can change dramatically depending on the time of year or
day of the week, requiring the tool to adjust its calculations
accordingly.
