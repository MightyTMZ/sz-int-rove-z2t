ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
===============================

Q: What is the logic behind the value-per-mile calculation?
A: The value-per-mile calculation divides the flight price by the number of Rove Miles required, helping users identify flights that provide the best value for their miles. This enables data-driven decisions about when to use miles vs. pay cash.

Q: How do you keep your data current?
A: We integrate directly with Amadeus API, which provides real-time flight data including availability, pricing, and routing. Our system makes live API calls for each search, ensuring users always see current information.

Q: How does this compare to existing tools?
A: Unlike generic flight search engines, our tool specifically optimizes for Rove Miles value, provides advanced filtering based on value-per-mile, and offers a modern, user-friendly interface focused on loyalty program optimization.

Q: What are the technical challenges you've overcome?
A: Key challenges included implementing robust token management for API authentication, designing an efficient caching system, creating a responsive frontend that handles complex flight data, and building a scalable backend architecture.

Q: How scalable is this solution?
A: The Django backend with PostgreSQL provides excellent scalability. The API-first architecture allows for easy integration with mobile apps and third-party services. The caching system reduces API calls and improves performance under load.
